# SolarsFourSeasons

This folder contains four independent texture packs, each one corresponding to a particular season. The packs were designed with the following considerations in mind:

- A minimal number of textures should be altered to allow use with other resource packs
- Textures should remain 16x and capture the authentic feel of vanilla minecraft
- Textures should be generalized enough to allow multiple uses and foster creativity
- Builds created with the texture pack should still look good without the pack enabled
- Builds created with any particular season enabled should look good in any other season

The packs take the following liberties

- New models and textures are introduced
- Builds created without the packs will not necessarily look good with them
- The concept of biome is disregarded with the pack (textures do not use tint indices)
- The pack was designed for use alongside the WBC Builds texture pack
